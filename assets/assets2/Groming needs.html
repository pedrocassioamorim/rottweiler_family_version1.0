<h1> Groming needs
</h1>
<p>Shareder and Potira had moderate grooming needs, given their Rottweiler coats. Their short, dense fur required regular brushing to control shedding and maintain a healthy coat. Bathing was done as needed, typically every few months, to keep them clean and fresh. Their nails required trimming to prevent overgrowth and discomfort. Additionally, routine ear cleaning and dental care were part of their grooming regimen to ensure overall hygiene. Both Shareder and Potira enjoyed grooming sessions, relishing the attention and affection they received during these moments, making it a bonding experience for all involved.
