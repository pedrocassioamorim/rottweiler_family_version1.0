<h1> Barking Tendency</h1>
<p>Shareder and Potira had different barking tendencies that reflected their individual personalities. Shareder, with his protective nature, barked assertively to alert us of any potential threats or strangers approaching. Potira, on the other hand, had a calmer demeanor and rarely barked unless it was necessary. Both were attentive and responsive to their surroundings, but Shareder's barking was more frequent due to his vigilant and watchful nature. Despite their differences, their barks served as a reminder of their dedication to keeping us safe and showcased their unique ways of communicating their love and loyalty.
